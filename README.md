# Assessment: "Proto" Implementation by Paul Tan

Java implementation of "Proto" for MyCity.

## Requirements

- **Java** (project was built with Java 11 but should work on Java 8 onwards)
- Maven

## Usage

Compile

`mvn compile`

And run

`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="gov.nyc.assessment.App"`

Project should be run from the root directory, as it will be looking for the "txnlog.dat" file (included).
